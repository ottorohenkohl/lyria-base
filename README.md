# lyria-base
Repository for various server applications.

## Description
The lyria-base repository is a group of different sub projects regarding server applications for my personal use.  
At the moment, the project is highly limited in it's funtionality and not quite stable.  
In the future, it should be the base of my own server infrastructure and  
should provide functionalities like a small weight CMS and some Smart Home tasks.  

## Structure
The project is structured in individual sub applications.  
Those should mostly run independent but with the possibility to integrate into each other.  
Because of the structure it's advised to run the project in an containerized environment like docker.  
The project should is mostly written in Dart because... Dart is awesome :heart:.  
(And a frontend could be written with Flutter)  

## Sub applications

### [lyria-auth](auth)
A application for anything regarding user management.  
For more information see the individual [README](auth/README.md).
